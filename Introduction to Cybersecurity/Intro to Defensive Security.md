- *Defensive Security* is focused on 
	- preventing intrusions from occurring,
	- detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly.

- Defensive security encompasses the following tasks:
	- Training users about cybersecurity awareness to prevent social engineering attacks.
	- Documenting and managing assets (think compliance and whiteteaming).
	- Updating and patching systems (CI/CD DevOps)
	- Setting up preventative security devices such as firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (network architecture and security).
	- Setting up logging and monitoring devices (security engineering).
	- Security Operations Center (SOC)
	- Threat Intelligence
	- Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
	- Malware Analysis (reverse engineering and binary exploitation).

**Threat Intelligence**

- Refers to information you gather about actual/potential enemies.
- Each company has different adversaries depending on their asset and objectives.

- *Digital Forensics* and *Incident Resopnse* are roles that are applied to counter threats to organizations.

- Digital Forensics involves analyzing file systems, system memory, logs, and network logs to find traces of evidence during and after an attack.

- One thing to note about Incident Response: this role is  performed *while* an attack is currently unfolding, and places the responder in a pressurised position with required assessments and responses under certain metrics.
